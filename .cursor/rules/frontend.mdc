Always, load the type type definitions from the Actions in the backend. Do not write your own types.

For form inputs, use the type from the backend action. For example, if the backend action is `SessionCreate`, the input type is `SessionCreate["inputs"]["_type"]`.

```
type SigninFormData = SessionCreate["inputs"]["_type"];
```

For api responses, use the type from the backend action. For example, if the backend action is `SessionCreate`, the response type is `ActionResponse<SessionCreate>`.

```
type SigninResponse = ActionResponse<SessionCreate>;
```

We write scss files for styling, not css.
