Whenever possible, use the `TypedError` class to throw errors.

After any modification of the models, we need to migrate. Never create the migration file yourself. Run `./botholomew.ts migrate` in the backend directory to migrate.

Do not try to run the server after making any change - it's probably already running by the developer. Instead, create tests.
