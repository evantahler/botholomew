# Botholomew Feature Roadmap

This document tracks potential features and enhancements for the Botholomew agent framework.

## Core Agent Features

- [ ] **Agent Memory/Context Storage** - Persistent memory across runs so agents can reference past interactions and maintain state
- [ ] **Agent Testing Framework** - Built-in test suites to evaluate agent performance and regression testing
- [ ] **Agent Versioning** - Track agent changes over time with rollback capability
- [ ] **Streaming Responses** - Real-time output streaming for long-running agent executions
- [ ] **Multi-Model Provider Support** - Add Anthropic Claude, local models, or other LLM providers beyond OpenAI

## Workflow Enhancements

- [ ] **Conditional Branching** - If/then/else logic in workflows based on agent output or conditions
- [ ] **Parallel Execution** - Run multiple workflow steps concurrently instead of sequentially
- [ ] **Human-in-the-Loop** - Workflow steps requiring manual approval/input before proceeding
- [ ] **Workflow Templates** - Pre-built workflow patterns for common use cases
- [ ] **Webhook Triggers** - Start workflows via external HTTP webhooks

## Monitoring & Operations

- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard** - Usage metrics, success rates, response times, and cost tracking per agent/workflow
- [ ] **Detailed Audit Logs** - Complete trace of agent actions, tool calls, and decisions
- [ ] **Alerting System** - Notifications for failed runs, errors, or unusual patterns
- [ ] **Performance Profiling** - Identify bottlenecks in agent/workflow execution

## Collaboration & Organization

- [ ] **Team/Organization Support** - Multi-user workspaces with role-based permissions
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace** - Share and discover pre-built agents and workflows
- [ ] **Comments & Annotations** - Team collaboration on agents and workflows

## Infrastructure & Integration

- [ ] **API Keys & Rate Limiting** - Public API access with usage controls
- [ ] **File/Document Processing** - Upload and process documents as agent inputs
- [ ] **Complete Pub/Sub Implementation** - Finish the TODOs for presence tracking and auth in `backend/initializers/pubsub.ts:8-9`

## Developer Experience

- [ ] **Agent Playground** - Interactive testing UI for rapid agent development
- [ ] **CLI Tool** - Command-line interface for CI/CD integration
- [ ] **SDK/Client Libraries** - Language-specific SDKs for easier integration
